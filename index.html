  </div>

  <p><strong>Born:</strong> February 5, 1985, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal</p>

  <h2>Early Life</h2>
  <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro grew up in a modest family in Madeira. From an early age, he stood out for his athletic talent and passion for football. He began at a local club, and at the age of 12, he joined Sporting CP’s academy in Lisbon, quickly attracting attention from both Portuguese and international clubs.</p>
  <p>His rapid development, speed, technique, and stamina soon earned him a spot in the senior team. Ronaldo was kicked out of school as a child for throwing a chair at his teacher who has made fun of him and his family. He underwent a heart surgery at the age of 15, but he didn't give up and was able to resume playing after a few weeks</p>

  <h2>Club Career</h2>
  <p>Ronaldo made his debut for Sporting CP’s first team in 2002 before signing with Manchester United in 2003. Under Sir Alex Ferguson, he became one of the best players in the world. He won three Premier League titles, an FA Cup, and the 2008 Champions League. That same year, he won his first Ballon d’Or.</p>
  <p>In 2009, he transferred to Real Madrid for a then-record fee, ushering in a new era for the club. Ronaldo broke numerous goal records, scoring over 450 goals in 438 matches, and won the Champions League four times (2014, 2016, 2017, 2018). He was also La Liga’s top scorer six times.</p>
  <p>In 2018, he joined Juventus, winning two Serie A titles and two Italian Cups, remaining a key player well into his thirties. In 2021, he returned to Manchester United before moving to Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia in 2023.</p>

  <h2>International Career</h2>
  <p>Ronaldo debuted for Portugal in 2003 and has since become a national icon. He led Portugal to their first major trophy at Euro 2016 and won the Nations League in 2019 and 2025. He heads into the 2026 World Cup as one of the team’s leaders.</p>
  <p>With over 190 caps and more than 120 goals, he is Portugal’s all-time leading scorer.</p>

  <h2>Personal Life</h2>
  <p>Ronaldo is known for being family-oriented and has four children. He is involved in multiple charity projects, including children’s homes and disaster relief efforts.</p>

    <strong>Focus: Cristiano Ronaldo — Early Career</strong>
    <p style="margin:8px 0 0;">
      <em>Why this matters:</em> The <strong>“Cristiano Ronaldo early career”</strong> phase shaped his playing style, work ethic and eventual global success. Below we expand on his youth years, first professional matches and rapid rise so the page ranks better for searches about Ronaldo's early development.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Ronaldo's Early Career — Detailed Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Ronaldo's youth career began at Andorinha, where his father worked and where his natural talent quickly showed. By the time he moved to Nacional and then to <strong>Sporting CP</strong>, scouts had already noticed his exceptional dribbling, ball control and goal threat.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Sporting's academy (Academia de Alcochete), Ronaldo's training intensified — he was coached in specialized speed and technical drills, and his performances in youth leagues earned him early promotion to the first team at just 17. In his Sporting debut season he impressed with a combination of flair and physical readiness unseen in many teenagers.

    <div class="item"><strong>1992–1997:</strong> Youth at Andorinha and Nacional — early foundations.</div>
    <div class="item"><strong>1997–2002:</strong> Sporting CP academy — technical development and breakthrough.</div>
    <div class="item"><strong>2002:</strong> Sporting CP first team debut (senior debut).</div>
    <div class="item"><strong>2003:</strong> Transfer to Manchester United — first major step into global football.</div>
  </div>

  <h2>Early Matches and Breakthrough</h2>
  <p>
    Ronaldo's first senior matches at Sporting displayed his willingness to take on defenders and an already refined finishing technique. His performance in a high-profile friendly against Manchester United in 2003 is widely credited as the moment Sir Alex Ferguson decided to sign him — a single match that changed his career path.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tactical lessons at United transformed Ronaldo from a talented winger into a complete forward: learning off-the-ball movement, crossing, set-piece efficiency and mental resilience in top-flight competition.
